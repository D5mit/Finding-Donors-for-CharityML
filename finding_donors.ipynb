    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "> Decision trees can be used by a bank to automatically determine if a person should get a loan. Especially if there are a number of rules that governs it.  For example the bank might have a policy that only people older than 25 may be granted a loan.  There might also be other criteria such as: a person with a degree, but no income at the moment, whould still be allowed a loan, but a person without a degree with no income might have no chance to get a loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "> Decision trees are generally simple to understand and to interpret. The trees can be visualised and requires little data preparation in comparison to other models. Even though decision trees then to overfit, if the data scenario is fairly simple, fitting the train data very close might lead to being able to fit the training data.\n",

    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",

Getting the right ratio of samples to number of features is important, since a tree with few samples in high dimensional space is very likely to overfit.  <br>*source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html*\n",

    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "> Firstly this is a classification problem, therefore a decision tree model is a possibility.  A decision tree is a common-sense technique to find the best solutions to problems with uncertainty. An oversimplified example, but should you take a jacket to work today? To find out, construct a simple decision-tree diagram.  Our finding donors usecase is possibly simular. Does the person have a above 50K income or not.  Common sense elemens such as education level, age etc. will have an impact.  Because of the simplicity and the advantages it poses, I would like to try it and see if there is a quick win. \n",

    "#### Model 2 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "> SVM are used in industry to amoung others, classify defects in bearings. In an example refered to in science direct, a hybrid two stage one-against-all Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is proposed for the automated diagnosis of defective rolling element bearings. \"The basic concept and major advantage of the method, is that its training can be performed using simulation data, which result from a well established model, describing the dynamic response of defective rolling element bearings. Then, vibration measurements, resulting from the machine under condition monitoring, can be imported and processed directly by the already trained SVM, eliminating thus the need of training the SVM with experimental data of the specific defective bearing.\"\n",

    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "> AdaBoost is a powerful classification algorithm that is used in a variety of fields, such as biology, computer vision, and speech processing.  AdaBoost is comonly used for face detection in images. It uses a rejection cascade consisting of many layers of classifiers. When the detection window is not recognized at any layer as a face, it is rejected. The first classifier in the window discards the negative window keeping the computational cost to a minimum. Though AdaBoost combines the weak classifiers, the principles of AdaBoost are also used to find the best features to use in each layer of the cascade. <br> *Source: https://www.educba.com/adaboost-algorithm/*\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "> Unlike other powerful classifiers, such as SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings (unless of course you choose to use SVM with AdaBoost). The user only needs to choose: (1) which weak classifier might work best to solve their given classification problem; (2) the number of boosting rounds that should be used during the training phase. The GRT enables a user to add several weak classifiers to the family of weak classifiers that should be used at each round of boosting. The AdaBoost algorithm will select the weak classifier that works best at that round of boosting. <br>*Source: https://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost*\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "> AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. The GRT AdaBoost algorithm does not currently support null rejection, although this will be added at some point in the near future. <br>*Source: https://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost*\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "> The model is relatively easy to implement and understand. It is also not prone to overfitting, therefore a good candidate model to use as the risk of overfitting and making a mistake with parameter tweaking is reduced. <br> *Source: http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~tcan/ceng734_f1112/Schedule/adaboost.pdf*\n",

In addition the AdaBoost model accuracy on test data is very simular to the accuracy on training data. This shows that it seems like the model is not overfitting. In terms of prediction and training time, AdaBoost takes longer than decision trees, but it is clear the SVM takes much longer than both AdaBoost and decision trees. The prediction and training time is perhaps more than that of decision trees, but it is still well within an acceptable range.  The algorithm is suitable to the data as it first uses weak learners to fit and therefore reduces overfitting. \n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
